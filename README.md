*Consensus feature selection for blind image quality assessment*

**The code info**
- codeBISA : the codes of diverse BISA algorithms  
- real_KonIQ : the prediction scores by using different BISA methods  
- scoreBISAground : the subjective scores of the KonIQ-10k dataset  

**Step by step data processing and results**
- s01singleBIQAmodel : the performance of BISA indicators  
- s02allBIQAmodels : the performance using BISA scores as the mid-level features for image quality assessment  
- s03conENFR : the selected features by using consensus-based feature selection  
- s04fusion : the performance using selected features for imag quality assessment  

**Our contributions**
<br />
  [1] Image quality assessment is formulated as a feature selection and score prediction problem.   
  [2] Learning-free and shallow-learning-based indicators perform as mid-level feature extractors, and consensus-based feature selection is proposed for informative feature screening.  
  [3] Fifteen indicators and four regression models are explored, and the hybrid indicator achieves considerable improvement on four realistic image datasets.
