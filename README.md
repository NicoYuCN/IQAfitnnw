# Highlights
  [1] Image quality assessment is formulated as a feature selection and score prediction problem.   
  [2] Learning-free and shallow-learning-based indicators perform as mid-level feature extractors,   
          \t and consensus-based feature selection is proposed for informative feature screening.  
  [3] Fifteen indicators and four regression models are explored,   
          \t and the hybrid indicator achieves considerable improvement on four realistic image datasets.
